# SRPN-Calculator
Saturated Reverse Polish Notation (SRPN) Calculator written in Python

### Background:

Reverse Polish notation (RPN), also known as reverse Łukasiewicz notation, Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN), in which operators precede their operands. It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. The description "Polish" refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented Polish notation in 1924.

### Task:

This project was to recreate a saturated reverse polish notation calculator that was provided to us via replit to interact with but being unable to see the source code. 

Therefore this was an investigatory project to discover fucntionality and then implement what we found in Python.

### How to run:

To use or run the SRPN, run: 
> python srpn.py

You can then interact manually with the calculator or use the tests by running the:
>test_srpn.py
